# FirstMCMod
My first Minecraft Mod,
coded in the Fabric mod loader.

# What does this mod do?
As of right now, the mod adds a new block called
"First Block" and an item called "First Item." More stuff is planned
In the future.

# How can I use this mod?
The mod doesn't do much right now, but if you want to get it, you can download
the latest GitHub release.

# Can I contribute to this?
Yes! All help is appreciated! You can contribute by forking this repo, then
Submitting a pull request.

# What's planned in the future?
My goal is to continue working on adding more content to the mod, then once I
Have a reasonable amount I will work on porting to the latest Minecraft versions, such as 1.17.
