# FirstMCMod
My first Minecraft Mod,
coded in the Fabric mod loader.

# What does this mod do?
As of right now, the mod adds a new block called
"First Block" and an item called "First Item." More stuff is planned
In the future.

# How can I use this mod?
The mod doesn't do much right now, but if you want to get it, you can download
the latest version on the GitHub releases tab.
I'm also planning to make a Modrinth and/or Curseforge page at some point.

# Can I contribute to this?
Yes! All help is appreciated! You don't even need toadd any code, all ideas are welcome!
You can also contribute the normal way; forking this repo, then submitting a pull request.

# Future goals and plans
My goal is to continue working on adding more content to the mod, then once I
have a reasonable amount of stuff implemented I will work on porting to the latest versions of Minecraft.

Current Minecraft version: 1.16.5

Target Minecraft version: 1.17
